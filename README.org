** Lalboard layout also usable on a laptop...
On lalboard there is 10 keys with 5 directions a tap could be registered.
Single taps I leave for function/symbol/number keys and use chording for english.
On a laptop I spread out directional taps between 3 rows and 2 layers. And use a separate Sturdy layer instead of chording. Because of lack of integration between keyd and lithium.el, I map commands to either of the layers, but not both, depending on the mode. It also kinda sorta keeps layout compatible with vanilla emacs.
Oh, and the whole thing is shifter one row up to allow for a bunch more thumb keys.
